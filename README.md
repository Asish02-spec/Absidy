# Description

**Absidy**, in essence is (rather aims to be) a safety guide to people migrating to/staying over in places they're new to. We plan to record already available (then extend it to mining real time) crime stats in a city to help people avoid renting a place or layovers in shady areas.

Additionally, armed with information about travel and safety related laws and helpline numbers of the locality, we aim to make it a traveller friendly, hassle-free substitute to asking around strangers for information or scrounging through the internet.

**Tech stack**:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - PHP  
 (Will add more as we move futhur with the project)
